Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artimas financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. Artemis wants to provide sucure communication to their client. Artimas wants to utilize most current security software as well as using software to find vulnerabilities. 

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

The overall sucess of a business depends on security and trust. A business must meet certain criteria when it comes to protecting user data.I think I did well in discovering vulnerabilities with in artimas's application. The process of writing clean code is vital to a apllications sucess.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

I found that in this project I have had issues with keystore and adding my cert to the application. I am in the process of working on this issue.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

I found dependecy checks to be helpful in finding vulnerabilities in the application. In most instances a fix was offered or had already been discovered, Sometime it is just a matter of updating software.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

One way to check if your code has introduced a new vulnerability is to run a second dependecy check.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I think in the fucture learning how to create certs,using dependecy checks, and supression files will be useful. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I think the ability to find vulnerabilities and create certs will showcase skilled learned. I do feel like at this point I will need to do more research to get a better understading of key elements.
